# FaceMaskdetector
Implementation for automated face mask detection using deep learning techniques and neural networks.
 explains a method of building a Face Mask Detector using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) Python, Keras, Tensorflow and OpenCV. With further improvements these types of models could be integrated with CCTV or other types cameras to detect and identify people without masks. With the prevailing worldwide situation due to COVID-19 pandemic, these types of systems would be very supportive for many kind of institutions around the world. Please let me know your ideas, suggestions and concerns in the comment section and feel free to improve this project yourself and come up with better results.
